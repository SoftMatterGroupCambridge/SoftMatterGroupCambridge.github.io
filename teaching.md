Professors Cates and Adhikari teach a Part III course of 24 lectures on **Noisy Mechanics**. This will run in Lent term 2026.

This course on Noisy Mechanics is intended to give a pragmatic introduction to noise effects,
focusing on how to predict the emergent behaviour in applications drawn from the various
fields mentioned above, both near and far from thermal equilibrium, and with emphasis on
phase separation and emergence of spatial patterns.

Professor Cates previously taught a cause on **Theoretical Physics of Soft Condensed Matter**.
