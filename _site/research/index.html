        <p>Soft Matter includes colloids, polymers, emulsions, foams, surfactant solutions, powders, liquid crystals, and similar materials. Many biological systems involve “active” soft matter which, like life itself, is sustained by a continuous supply of energy. Recently we have also started working on the statistical physics of active matter outside the realm of soft materials, addressing models of nucleation and extinction in settings such as ecology, social interactions, and epidemics.</p>

<p>Using both analytic and computational methods, the group addresses fundamental problems, such as how the basic principles of statistical mechanics are modified by activity; how to coarse-grain dynamics from particle level to descriptions in terms of continuous fields; applications of differential geometry in soft matter; and use of stochastic thermodynamics and large deviation theory to study the statistics of rare events. We also have a track record of addressing more applied issues, such as how to predict the remarkable flow properties and jamming behaviour of dense suspensions.</p>

<p>The mathematical methods used within the group include statistical field theory; exact and approximate solution of stochastic differential equations and PDEs; particle-based simulation; differential geometry; and numerical simulation of continuum field equations. In some areas, as much time is spent figuring out what the proper equations of motion are, as is spent solving them: the field offers great scope for scientific as well as mathematical creativity. We have strong collaborations with researchers around the world.</p>
