Professor Mike Cates, appointed in 2015 as the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, is head of the Soft Matter Research Group in DAMTP. The other permanent academic staff are Dr Ronojoy Adhikari, and Prof. Rob Jack (joint appointment with Chemistry Department). At any time the group has a number of self-funded research fellows and/or grant-funded postdocs, plus typically 5-10 PhD students. 

We are always looking for motivated students and postdocs to join the **Soft Matter Group**.  


##### **PhD students**

We welcome PhD applications. An idea of the type of work currently in progress can be seen from the selected publications listed on the staff webpages linked in the opening paragraph above.

Here are some of the areas in which PhD projects may be available:
- Active field theories on moving manifolds from the perspective of modern differential geometry (Dr Adhikari)
- Morphogenesis and moving manifolds (Dr Adhikari)
- Active micropolar elasticity and the mechanics of tissues (Dr Adhikari)
- Rare events in non-equilibrium classical and quantum systems, using large deviation theory (Prof Jack)
- Statistical mechanics of pattern formation in active mixtures (Prof Jack)


Please check the [DAMTP PhD admissions page](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/maampdmtp) for details on how to apply.

##### P**ostdoctoral researchers**
Opportunities may be available through fellowships (e.g. Royal Society, Marie Skłodowska-Curie, Leverhulme). Contact us to discuss possibilities.

The group has recently been awarded a £1.2M UKRI Grant to study Nucleation and Extinction in Non-equilibrium Statistical Field Theories. This will fund two postdoctoral research fellows for the next four years.

##### **Visitors and collaborations**
We welcome visits from researchers interested in soft matter, active matter, and related topics. Get in touch if you’d like to collaborate.
