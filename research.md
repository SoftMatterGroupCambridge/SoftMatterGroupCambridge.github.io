Soft Matter includes colloids, polymers, emulsions, foams, surfactant solutions, powders, liquid crystals, and similar materials. Many biological systems involve "active" soft matter which, like life itself, is sustained by a continuous supply of energy. Recently we have also started working on the statistical physics of active matter outside the realm of soft materials, addressing models of nucleation and extinction in settings such as ecology, social interactions, and epidemics.

Using both analytic and computational methods, the group addresses fundamental problems, such as how the basic principles of statistical mechanics are modified by activity; how to coarse-grain dynamics from particle level to descriptions in terms of continuous fields; applications of differential geometry in soft matter; and use of stochastic thermodynamics and large deviation theory to study the statistics of rare events. We also have a track record of addressing more applied issues, such as how to predict the remarkable flow properties and jamming behaviour of dense suspensions.

The mathematical methods used within the group include statistical field theory; exact and approximate solution of stochastic differential equations and PDEs; particle-based simulation; differential geometry; and numerical simulation of continuum field equations. In some areas, as much time is spent figuring out what the proper equations of motion are, as is spent solving them: the field offers great scope for scientific as well as mathematical creativity. We have strong collaborations with researchers around the world.

  <summary>Active Phase Separation</summary>
  <p>
    Recent work by the group has shown that active fluids—systems made of self-driven particles—can undergo phase separation in ways that have no equilibrium counterpart. Instead of forming a single large dense domain, activity can stabilise long-lived bubbles, foams, and other microstructured states. This arises because active particles generate steady-state fluxes across interfaces, breaking the thermodynamic rules that normally govern coarsening, and leading to novel active interfacial physics.

  <summary>Exact Hydrodynamics</summary>
  <p>
    The group develops exact hydrodynamic descriptions of active lattice gases to uncover how microscopic self-propulsion reshapes large-scale dynamics. For example, in active-passive mixtures, deriving continuum equations directly from underlying particle rules, reveals that activity generates intrinsically non-reciprocal interactions, where active and passive components influence one another in asymmetric ways. These effects fundamentally modify phase behaviour, allowing patterns and density waves to emerge. The exact hydrodynamic framework provides a powerful lens for understanding how driven particles organise, showing how travelling fronts and other dynamical steady states arise from minimal local rules. We also use an exact hydrodynamic description to investigate wetting and surface effects in active systems.
